Popup surveys lets you ask visitors questions about your site. Use this feedback to build a better blog or business.

== Description ==

Don't guess what your visitors want, ask them directly - right on your website.

Popup surveys allows you to ask visitors directly on your website about your blog, your business, your products, or ANYTHING else.

You can use this feedback to build better landing pages, improve your products, or increase the effectivness of your website.

This is a full featured plugin where you can build 3 kinds of surveys:

* Multiple choice surveys (with an unlimited number of choices)
* Net promoter score
* Text response

All of the results are stored on your OWN website, and no information is shared with any external server.

Other features:

* Create an unlimited amount of surveys
* Run multiple surveys at the same time (only one will be displayed to a user at once)
* Control the delay before displaying a survey

Install and enjoy!
