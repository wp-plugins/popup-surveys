Popup surveys lets you ask visitors questions about your site. Use this feedback to build a better blog or business.

== Description ==

Don't guess what your visitors want, ask them directly - right on your website.

Popup surveys allows you to ask visitors directly on your website about your blog, your business, your products, or ANYTHING else, by creating popup surveys or polls that your visitors will see on ANY page of your website. 

You can use this feedback to build better landing pages, improve your products, or increase the effectivness of your website.

This is a full featured plugin where you can build 3 kinds of surveys:

* Multiple choice surveys (with an unlimited number of choices)
* Net promoter score
* Text response

All of the results are stored on your OWN website, and no information is shared with any external server.

Other features:

* Create an unlimited amount of surveys
* Run multiple surveys at the same time (only one will be displayed to a user at once)
* Control the delay before displaying a survey

This plugin contains full functionality and doesn't lock down features like other survey or poll plugins do.

In addition, other survey or poll plugins create custom post types that need to be organized or placed into custom categories (or even displayed on at the bottom of your existing content). Popup Surveys instead creates popups that can appear on any page of your website, and are unintrusive of your content. 

Get results without ruining the user experience of your site. 

Install and enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many surveys/polls can I create? =

You can create as many popup surveys/polls as you like.

= Can I change the theme of the survey? =

Right now there is no option to change the look and feel of the survey. However, this is a feature that will be implemented in future releases of popup surveys.

= How many multiple choice answers can I add to a survey/poll? =

You can add unlimited answers to the multiple choice surveys. However, if you add to many, it may be difficult for users to use :)

= What types of questions can I ask? =

You can ask three kinds of questions in your survey:

* Multiple choice

* Text answers

= Do you have survey templates built into the plugin? =

No, but this is a feature that will be implemented in the future

= Is my data safe? =

Your data is stored on your own server, and only you will have access to it. Therefore, your data is as safe as your own web server.

= Can I use multiple questions in one survey/poll? =

At this time there is only an option to have a single question. However, this will be implemented into future versions of popup polls.

At this time each survey/poll will show up on all pages of your site. In the future, we will be adding functionality to allow surveys on specific URLS or pages of your site.

== Screenshots ==

1. Create or edit polls from one easy screen. Popup Surveys doesn't create new custom post types, so there's nothing to organize, and the plugin will not adjust any of your existing Wordpress settings.
2. Add as many answers to multiple choice question surveys as you want.
3. Customize the call to action text on your survey/poll.
4. Customize the delay before a user sees your survey, or adjust how many times each user will see a survey or poll.
